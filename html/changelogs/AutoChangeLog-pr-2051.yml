changes:
  - rscadd: "The Beretta has been buffed significantly, and now resembles a higher-capacity M4A3 with less bullet damage. It also has a small chance to spawn as the 93R police issue burstfire variant."
  - rscadd: "The Hipower has been completely reworked and redesigned into a new weapon, with new sprites, new inhands, new lore, new stats. It fires 14 bullets that push back (not knock back) close targets when struck."
  - rscadd: "The Deagle's normal shots (unobtainable by COs) throw back any hit targets like heavy m44, and deal great damage. However, the gun is very inaccurate."
  - rscadd: "The PK9 has recieved an accuracy buff as it was hitting nothing."
  - rscadd: "The KT-42 has been made into a cross between a mod88 and a VP, quickly firing strong, inaccurate AP bullets."
  - rscadd: "The unfinished RXM5-EVA pistol has been finished! With its own unique codersprite for inhands. It fires weak non-AP red laser bolts that deal some stamina damage and have a small chance of weakly igniting the target. Only really accessible in New Varadero for now."
  - imageadd: "Added attachment sprites for every bayonet type."
  - balance: "The CMB revolver has received a complete overhaul. It has completely refreshed alien isolation sounds, has gotten a complete stat pass, and now fires by default hollowpoint rounds (Like in Isolation!)"
  - rscadd: "The S&W 'model 48' revolver is very powerful, but also inaccurate. You will be able to focus on your shots better if you do some cool tricks with it first?"
  - rscadd: "Nagant: Shrapnel shot has unique handful sprites."
  - rscadd: "BR blasters have USCM pistol placeholder inhands."
  - spellcheck: "removed a misuse of an improper escape verb on the purchasable folding barricades crate."
