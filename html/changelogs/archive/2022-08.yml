  JeserTheFox:
  - balance: Hardpoints require 10 seconds to apply acid to them to prevent easy combat
      melting.
  - balance: Vehicles require 3 seconds to apply acid instead of 4 and receive twice
      more damage for it.
  Kaga:
  - bugfix: Fixed an unintended oversight where mobs were taking damage calculated
      for runners from the Aimed Shot ability when used by an XMB or M42C sniper rifle.
      Normal-size Xenos now have their own tier for damage calculation.
  Tisx:
  - balance: Changed GAU impacts from a purely explosive damage model to a more ballistic
      one for greater fine tuning.
  - spellcheck: Renamed GAU ammo types; standard is now PGU-100 Multi-purpose. HV
      is now PGU-105 Anti-Tank
  - balance: Current damage numbers for GAU are; 150 damage 10 AP for multi-purpose.
      95 damage and 40 AP (2x the bullets however) for Anti-tank
  - balance: Point cost for both ammo types have been changed to be more equivalent
      with each other.
  - qol: Getting directly hit by a GAU shell will now display a message (same as getting
      hit by any other bullet)
  - soundadd: Added in some new sounds to the GAU to spice things up a bit.
