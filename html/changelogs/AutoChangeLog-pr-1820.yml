changes:
  - code_imp: "Adds two new hive traits. NO_HVE_DELAY and NO_COLOR. Delay regards to round end and if they need to be wiped out or not. Color regards to xeno colours, not weeds or anything else."
  - code_imp: "Examining xenos or structures now show the name of the hive they belong to, rather than bastardising it by using [Hive.prefix] Hive"
