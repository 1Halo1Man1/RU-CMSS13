  - rscdel: "Removed almost all the PMC corpses from all the maps. Replaced them with W-Y Security Guards (goons)"
  - rscadd: "Sprinkled some soul in some nightmare inserts that hosted these PMC corpses because i cannot help myself. For example the LV crash and hydro holds have some wooden barricades, the big red admin hold got some mostly-empty M41 magazine boxes."
  - rscadd: "Almost all of the PMC corpse spawns' NSG 23s and magazines were replaced with corpo M41s equipped with rubber bullets. Where relevant, there are also normal magazines that can be picked up, such as the big red offices crashed ship."
